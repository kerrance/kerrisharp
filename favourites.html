        <h2>Books</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>"A Tale for the Time Being" by Ruth Ozeki</strong> Meditations on Zen Buddhism through the lens of a
            tale of two souls, connected by a tragic real world event.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Talks With a Devil" by P.D. Ouspensky</strong> Two allegorical stories about the nature of the
            devil from the Slavic mythos. Devils thrive from our materialism and rationalisations. My copy came with a
            totally tubular 1980's fantasy novel cover art from the Theosophical Society's own lending library. I've
            grown very interested in the words of Gurdjieff since reading Alan Watts and Ouspensky's fictional tales
            seemed like a great introduction to the "magnificent old rascal".
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>
              "The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers" by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)
            </strong>
            A must-read for any software programmer. If you've ever been, or wish to be paid to write code, then this
            book is for you.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"After the Quake" by Haruki Murakami</strong> Short story collection, synthesizing Murakami's themes
            into a light-hearted neat package: family, history, fantasy based on reality, theism and tragedy.
          </li>

          <!--

            <strong>
              "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing" by Marie Kondō
            </strong>
          </li>

          <li>

        <h2>TV</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Detectorists</strong> Nobody would believe that a comedy drama about metal detecting could be so
            enriching for the soul. Incredibly wholesome, funny and sometimes bitter-sweet all at the same time.
          </li>

            <strong>Attack on Titan</strong>

        <h2>Games</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>TUNIC</strong> That's it &ndash; pack it up, ladies and gentlemen. This is quite possibly the best
            game ever made, we can all go home now. Esoteric lore and a slowly unfolding list of puzzles combine with a
            beautiful artwork and a delicious soundtrack. To top it off, TUNIC's greatest trick is that it hides its
            truths in plain site.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Tetris Effect</strong> Everything in its right place. Throw your best pair of headphones on and
            experience the most trippy and captivating way of clearing lines of blocks to date.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Hollow Knight</strong>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Stardew Valley</strong>
          </li>
          -->

          <li>
            <strong>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</strong> Silky smooth, saccharine multiplayer fun in HD. They actually made the
            confectionery kart game from "Wreck It Ralph" a reality! I've played all of the Mario Kart games, I would
            struggle to pick a favourite. I think Double Dash on the GameCube was the most fun, but Mario Kart 8 is the
            most accessible to date.
