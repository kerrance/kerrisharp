        <p>I am a British software engineer and web developer.</p>

        <p>
          In my career, I always want to create honest, well-designed bespoke applications, websites and emails. I use a
          variety of tools, frameworks and languages to achieve this goal. Attention to detail and forward-thinking are
          my specialities.

        <p>
          Sigma7 provides risk services for an increasingly unpredictable world. Their platforms and products help
          customers to understand, manage and respond to their risk across the globe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am working as part of the engineering team at Sigma7 to build a suite of exciting new web

        <h3>Software Engineer, Intelligence Fusion. 2021 &ndash; 2024</h3>

        <p>
          I was working to build exciting web applications for Intelligence Fusion which allowed greater access to the
          threat intelligence data reported internally by their intelligence analysts. I also helped develop background
          services as well as enhancing and increasing their API offering with additional features and enhancements.

        <h3>Web Developer, Think Productive. 2020 &ndash; 2021</h3>

        <p>
          I rebuilt the customer-facing websites for all of Think Productive's global regions. I also created a bespoke,
          asynchronous learning platform for customers to continue their learning after having attended live sessions.

        <h3>Web Developer, Opia. 2016 &ndash; 2020</h3>
