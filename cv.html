          <h2>Software Engineer, Intelligence Fusion / Sigma7</h2>

          <span class="dates">2021 &ndash; Present</span>
        </header>

        <p>
          Developed full-stack web applications, APIs and services for accessing threat intelligence data and risk
          services.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Built a fully-documented "Notes" service to enable user-generated content within the application. Empowering
            customers to create and share additional context with their colleagues
          </li>

          <li>
            Led a "hackathon" where my team built a "Spotify Wrapped"-alike for our intelligence analysts, summarising
            their efforts over the year with a humorous presentation improving team morale and encouraging competition
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a system to dynamically generate and embed map images of incident locations into customer email
            notifications, improving client awareness and communication
          </li>

          <li>
            Implemented authentication logging so that customers could scrutinise and keep track of login attempts
          </li>

          <li>
            Built a multi-factor authentication system that greatly improved application security and enabled the
            business to onboard new clients with this requirement
          </li>

          <li>
            Rewrote a large chunk of legacy code to remove event-driven architecture, enabling intelligence analysts to
            keep country information and statistics up-to-date
          </li>

          <li>
            Implemented regular automated data ingestion from the third-party Dragonfly API to display alongside
            internally generated intelligence data
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a customer-facing website with Jekyll to document our APIs and upcoming feature work roadmap,
            increasing the opportunity for the company to sell data-access to API customers
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Web Developer, Think Productive</h2>

          <span class="dates">2020 &ndash; 2021</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a WordPress parent theme using PHP 5.6, SASS &amp; JS (ES6, jQuery) with a fresh design as a central
            part of the company's global rebrand. The theme provided modern features, improved performance &amp;
            usability, leading to increased website versatility and sales.
          </li>

          <li>
            Reduced reliance on third-party WordPress plugins from 63 down to 4 by writing many bespoke features into
            the parent theme, improving page load times and reducing employee frustration by making the website simpler
            to manage.
          </li>

          <li>
            Built a WordPress plugin using PHP 7.4, JS (jQuery) &amp; CSS to create an asynchronous learning platform,
            empowering thousands of delegates globally to access workshop materials on-demand in multiple different
            languages. The company previously relied on an expensive, third-party solution which was prone to frequent
            outages. Building an internal solution reduced employee and customer frustration as there has been no
            downtime of this feature since I built it.
          </li>

          <li>
            Converted a central WordPress "multisite network" database configuration into several, smaller databases
            using MySQL. This gave each of the six global branches the flexibility to manage, localise and translate
            their own websites in order to meet their regional marketing and sales goals.

          <h2>Web Developer, Opia</h2>

          <span class="dates">2016 &ndash; 2020</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed hundreds of sales promotion websites for technology companies including Google, Dell and HP using
            PHP 7.4 (Laravel, Symfony, Blade), Vue.js, SASS (Bootstrap) &amp; MySQL, deployed via DigitalOcean with
            Docker &amp; Jenkins. These campaigns rewarded customers with cashback and gifts, incentivising tens of
            thousands of purchases, helping Opia's clients to meet their sales targets and strengthen brand loyalty.
          </li>

          <li>
            Led email campaign development, creating responsive HTML emails (MJML, Foundation for Email), tested with
            Litmus and delivered via Mailgun on behalf of technology companies including Samsung, Microsoft and LG. My
            work increased trust by reinforcing brand identity across digital communications and garnered positive
            client and customer feedback.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a serial number validation system with PHP and regex pattern matching to pre-validate customer
            claims. This change significantly lowered the amount of exploratory work required by the customer service
            team and reduced customer frustration.
          </li>

          <li>
            Represented the company at industry events by delivering presentations promoting best practices in
            responsive HTML email development. This helped establish Opia as a forward-thinking, tech-first employer and
            increased the number of job applications received from developers.
