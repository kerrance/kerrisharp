          <h2>Software Engineer, Intelligence Fusion / Sigma7</h2>

          <span class="dates">2021 &ndash; Present</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a fully-documented "Notes" REST API with 100% test coverage using PHP 8.3 (Slim), PostgreSQL &
            deployed via AWS to enable user-generated content. This allowed customers to create and share additional
            context with their colleagues within the company's applications.
          </li>

          <li>
            Greatly enhanced email notifications by embedding dynamically generated map images of incident locations
            using PHP 8.3 (Slim), MapTiler API, MJML & CSS. This improved client awareness by warning them of threats or
            dangers occuring in their locations of interest.
          </li>

          <li>
            Implemented data ingestion from the third-party "Dragonfly" API to display alongside internally published
            intelligence data using PHP 8 (Lumen) to provide customers with additional data sources.
          </li>

          <li>
            Built multi-factor authentication and authentication logging with PHP 8.3 (Slim) into our internal
            "Authentication" REST API. This greatly improved application security and enabled the business to onboard
            new customers who required enhanced security.
          </li>

          <li>
            Delved into CQRS to update a legacy, event-driven, PHP API (Lumen). My work enabled intelligence analysts to
            keep information and statistics up-to-date via the event stream.
          </li>

          <li>
            Led a "hackathon" as project manager where my team built a "Spotify Wrapped"-alike using React, Vite,
            TypeScript, CSS and deployed with Netlify. Making use of our internal APIs, we summarised the efforts of our
            individual intelligence analysts over the year with a humorous presentation, which improved team morale and
            encouraged competition.
          </li>

          <li>
            Contributed to the creation of an internal "Notifications" service written in GoLang, deployed as an AWS
            Lambda. The service runs continuously, processing and sending notifications from payloads received via AWS
            SQS. This enabled us to offer enhanced customisation of notifications to customers and save on third-party
            service costs.
          </li>

          <li>
            Worked on a project to create a 'service status' page, deployed as an AWS Lambda function written in GoLang
            & TypeScript. The system monitoring was powered with uptime statistics from AWS CloudWatch and enables
            customers to know at a glance whether services are live or suffering downtime.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a customer-facing "Developer" website with Jekyll (Markdown, Liquid, SASS, jQuery) to document the
            company's APIs and feature roadmap. This increased sales to customers who wanted intelligence data to power
            their own frontend.

          <h2>Web Developer, Think Productive</h2>

          <span class="dates">2020 &ndash; 2021</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a WordPress parent theme using PHP 5.6, SASS &amp; JS (ES6, jQuery) with a fresh design as a central
            part of the company's global rebrand. The theme provided modern features, improved performance &amp;
            usability, leading to increased website versatility and sales.
          </li>

          <li>
            Reduced reliance on third-party WordPress plugins from 63 down to 4 by writing many bespoke features into
            the theme, improving page load times and reducing employee frustration by making the website simpler to
            manage.
          </li>

          <li>
            Built a WordPress plugin using PHP 7.4, JS (jQuery) &amp; CSS to create an asynchronous learning platform,
            empowering thousands of delegates globally to access workshop materials on-demand in multiple different
            languages. The company previously relied on an expensive, third-party solution which was prone to frequent
            outages. Building an internal solution reduced employee and customer frustration as there has been no
            downtime of this feature since I built it.
          </li>

          <li>
            Converted a central WordPress "multisite network" database configuration into several, smaller databases
            using MySQL. This gave each of the six global branches the flexibility to manage, localise and translate
            their own websites in order to meet their regional marketing and sales goals.

          <h2>Web Developer, Opia</h2>

          <span class="dates">2016 &ndash; 2020</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed hundreds of sales promotion websites for technology companies including Google, Dell and HP using
            PHP 7.4 (Laravel, Symfony, Blade), Vue.js, SASS (Bootstrap) &amp; MySQL, deployed via DigitalOcean with
            Docker &amp; Jenkins. These campaigns rewarded customers with cashback and gifts, incentivising tens of
            thousands of purchases, helping Opia's clients to meet their sales targets and strengthen brand loyalty.
          </li>

          <li>
            Led email campaign development, creating responsive HTML emails (MJML, Foundation for Email), tested with
            Litmus and delivered via Mailgun on behalf of technology companies including Samsung, Microsoft and LG. My
            work increased trust by reinforcing brand identity across digital communications and garnered positive
            client and customer feedback.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a serial number validation system with PHP and regex pattern matching to pre-validate customer
            claims. This change significantly lowered the amount of exploratory work required by the customer service
            team and reduced customer frustration.
          </li>

          <li>
            Represented the company at industry events by delivering presentations promoting best practices in
            responsive HTML email development. This helped establish Opia as a forward-thinking, tech-first employer and
            increased the number of job applications received from developers.
