          <h2>Software Engineer, Intelligence Fusion / Sigma7</h2>

          <span class="dates">2021 &ndash; Present</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a fully-documented "Notes" REST API using PHP 8 (Slim), PostgreSQL &amp; deployed via AWS to enable
            customers to share user generated content with their colleagues within the company's applications.
          </li>

          <li>
            Enhanced incident email notifications by dynamically generating map images using PHP 8 (Slim), MapTiler API,
            MJML &amp; CSS, improving client awareness of threats or dangers occuring in their locations of interest.
          </li>

          <li>
            Implemented the third-party "Dragonfly" API to display their data alongside internally published
            intelligence using PHP 8 (Lumen) to provide customers with more sources.
          </li>

          <li>
            Delved into CQRS to update a legacy, event-driven, PHP API (Lumen), allowing intelligence analysts to keep
            information and statistics up-to-date via the event stream.
          </li>

          <li>
            Crafted core components using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind & Storybook as part of a Scrum team for a
            next-generation MVP. This frontend empowers customers to access risk & intelligence services in a brand new
            way.
          </li>

          <li>
            Led a team as project manager to build a "Spotify Wrapped"-alike using React, Vite, TypeScript, CSS &amp;
            deployed with Netlify. Using internal APIs, we annually summarised the efforts of intelligence analysts with
            a humorous presentation, improving team morale &amp; encouraging competition.
          </li>

          <li>
            Helped create a "Notifications" service written in Go 1.2, deployed as an AWS Lambda, which continuously
            processes &amp; sends notifications from AWS SQS payloads, offering enhanced user customisation of
            notifications and savings on third-party service costs.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a "Service Status" page as part of a team, interpreting uptime statistics from AWS CloudWatch,
            deployed as an AWS Lambda written in Go 1.7, React, TypeScript &amp; Tailwind.
          </li>

          <li>
            Built a "Developer" website in Jekyll (Markdown, Liquid, SASS, JS) to document the company's APIs, resulting
            in increased sales from API-only customers.
          </li>

          <h2>Web Developer, Think Productive</h2>

          <span class="dates">2020 &ndash; 2021</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a WordPress theme using PHP 5.6, SASS &amp; JS (ES6, jQuery) with a fresh design as a core part of
            the company's global rebrand. The theme provided modern features, improved performance &amp; usability,
            leading to increased website versatility and sales.
          </li>

          <li>
            Reduced reliance on third-party WordPress plugins from 63 down to 4 by writing many bespoke features into
            the theme, improving page load times and reducing employee frustration by making the website simpler to
            manage.
          </li>

          <li>
            Built a WordPress plugin using PHP 7.4, JS (jQuery) &amp; CSS to create an asynchronous learning platform,
            empowering thousands of delegates globally to access workshop materials on-demand in multiple languages. My
            work replaced an expensive, third-party solution, prone to frequent outages. I reduced employee &amp;
            customer frustration with zero downtime of this feature since I built it.
          </li>

          <li>
            Converted a WordPress "multisite" into several, smaller databases with MySQL, giving all global branches the
            flexibility to manage, localise &amp; translate their own websites to meet their regional marketing and
            sales goals.
          </li>

          <h2>Web Developer, Opia</h2>

          <span class="dates">2016 &ndash; 2020</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed hundreds of sales promotion websites for clients including Google, Dell &amp; HP using PHP 7.4
            (Laravel, Symfony, Blade), Vue.js, SASS (Bootstrap) &amp; MySQL, deployed via DigitalOcean with Docker &amp;
            Jenkins. These campaigns rewarded customers with cashback and gifts, incentivising tens of thousands of
            purchases, helping Opia's clients to meet their sales targets and strengthen brand loyalty.
          </li>

          <li>
            Led email campaign development, creating responsive HTML emails (MJML, Foundation for Email), tested with
            Litmus and delivered via Mailgun on behalf of clients including Samsung, Microsoft &amp; LG. My work
            increased trust by reinforcing brand identity across digital communications and garnered positive client
            &amp; customer feedback.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a serial number validation system with PHP regex pattern matching to pre-validate customer claims.
            This reduced the amount of exploratory work required by the customer service team, minimising customer
            frustration.
