        <h3>My name is Kerri Mark Sharp.</h3>
      </header>

      <p>I currently live in Somerset, England with my wife and our daughter.</p>

      <p>I am a British software engineer and web developer.</p>

      <p>
        In the past, I have been a podcast host, journalist, radio &amp; club DJ and record label manager. I even once
        worked as head of digital for an election campaign. Digital media, and especially the internet, is very
        important to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am curious, empathetic and always seeking the truth. My most firmly held value is to "see the bigger picture".
        Critical thinking and asking questions are very important to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy singing, dancing and listening to music. I have a playlist for every occasion! I have also recently
        discoverd that I enjoy pantomime and musical theatre! My favourite video games are Tetris, Age of Empires 2
        &amp; Mario Kart.
      </p>

      <p>
        My claim to fame is that I am mentioned in the song
        <a href="//youtube.com/watch?v=e9kff6P7mKU" target="_blank">Fans (Are So Cool)</a> by Kero Kero Bonito.
      </p>

      <p>My writing is collected on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. I also quite like <a href="/adages">adages</a>.</p>
