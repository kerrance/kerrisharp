        Everything on this website is a work-in-progress. It's unlikely that it will stay the same forever, I will
        always be tinkering, but I will try and keep pages evergreen, or at least up-to-date where I can.
      </p>

      <p>Listed below are some of the pages you can find here on this website:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a> me and who I am</li>
        <li><a href="/cv">CV</a> find out more about my work</li>
        <li><a href="/favourites">Favourites</a> some of the things that I cherish the most</li>
      </ul>
