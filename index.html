    <h2>Truth seeker, software engineer and web developer</h2>

    <p>I am a British software developer currently living in Somerset, England.</p>

    <p>
      In my career, I always want to create honest, well-designed bespoke applications, websites and emails.
      I use a variety of tools, frameworks and languages to achieve this goal. Attention to detail and forward-thinking
      are my specialities. If you are interested in finding out about my work, you can

      I enjoy singing, practicing Brazilian jiujitsu and playing Mario Kart.
