    <h2>How do I do all this stuff?</h2>

    <p>There's a lot I still have to learn (isn't that always true?). However, below is a brief list of my tools and resources I use to do my job work.</p>

    <h3>What's in my toolbox?</h3>

    <p>Here's a brief rundown of my "tools of the trade":</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Computer</strong>HP EliteBook</li>
      <li><strong>Operating System</strong>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor</strong>HP 25mx 24.5inch 144Hz FHD</li>
      <li><strong>Keyboard</strong>Logitech K380</li>
      <li><strong>Mouse</strong>Logitech Pebble M350</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting</strong>GitHub Pages</li>
      <li><strong>Text Editors</strong>PhpStorm, Sublime Text, Node</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How did I learn all this?</h3>

    <p>I'm always learning new techniques and skills. These are some of my favourite learning resources for when I need to brush up my pallete:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://laracasts.com/" target="_blank">Laracasts</a></strong>Jeffrey Way gets a lot of bad press. I'm not really sure why because the videos on his Laracasts platform are often informative and very helpful. I've learned a fair bit about Laravel from the video tutorials, but also PHP syntax and Object Oriented programming.
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/" target="_blank">Tania Tascia</a></strong>Tania's policy of "<a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/learn" target="_blank">learning in public</a>" has led to the creation of some unmissable tutorials and guides for both beginners and veteran developers. I'm (slowly) working through them all. In particular I'm focusing on working through her Vue and Javascript guides.
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/thomashockaday" target="_blank">Thomas Hockaday</a></strong>If you are in a position to: utilise the knowledge and skills of your colleagues to enrich your own learning. Thomas has some brilliant resources on his GitHub profile. I have learned a great deal from his open-source solutions.
      <li><strong>Practice!</strong>Most of what I have learned has been through trial-and-error. Even on the most basic level, you can teach yourself the fundamentals of web development (HTML, CSS, jQuery etc) quite easily. Find something you like online and inspect the code through your browser (Right click and select 'View Page Source'). Challenge yourself to try and recreate what you see using your computers text editor! Don't be afraid to tinker endlessly until you are happy with the results.</li>
    </ul>
