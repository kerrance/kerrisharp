    <h2>Truth seeker, explorer and software engineer</h2>

    <p>I am a British software developer currently living in Somerset, England.</p>

    <p>
      In my career, I always want to create honest, well-designed bespoke applications, websites and emails.
      I use a variety of tools, frameworks and languages to achieve this goal. Attention to detail and forward-thinking
      are my specialities. If you are interested in finding out about my work, you can
      <a href="kerrisharp-cv.pdf" download>download my CV</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an additional part of my career development, I am currently teaching myself Golang by building a 'Pokédex'
      application which will allow you to search for and display information about a Pokémon within Slack. You can
      <a href="https://github.com/kerrance/go-hisui" target="_blank">follow my progress with Hisui on Github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare-time, I enjoy singing in my car, making up silly dances and practicing Brazilian jiujitsu. I also run
      the <a href="https://minerva.ink/" target="_blank">Owl of Minerva webblog</a> where I write
      about theology, history, art, self-remembering and conciousness.
