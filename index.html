    <section>
      <p>My name is Kerri Sharp-Scott.</p>

      <p>I am a British software engineer and web developer.</p>

      <p>
        I am curious, empathetic and always seeking the truth. My most firmly held value is to "see the bigger picture".
        Critical thinking and asking questions are very important to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy singing, dancing and playing video games like Tetris, Age of Empires and Mario Kart. I quite like
        <a href="/adages">adages</a> also.
      </p>

      <p>I live in Somerset, England with my wife and our daughter.</p>
