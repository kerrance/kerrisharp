    <h2>Truth seeker, software engineer and web developer</h2>

    <p>I am a British software developer currently living in Somerset, England.</p>

    <p>
      In my career, I always want to create honest, well-designed bespoke applications, websites and emails. I use a
      variety of tools, frameworks and languages to achieve this goal. Attention to detail and forward-thinking are my
      specialities.
    </p>

    <p>I enjoy singing, practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu and playing Mario Kart.</p>
