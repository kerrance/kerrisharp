    <h2>Truth seeker and software engineer</h2>

    <p>I am a British software developer currently living in Somerset, England.</p>

    <p>I always want to create honest, well-designed bespoke applications, websites and emails. I use a variety of tools, frameworks and languages to achieve this goal. Attention to detail and forward-thinking are my specialities.</p>

    <p>I like music, history, theosophy, martial arts, F1 and esoteric lore.</p>

    <p>Everything on this website is a work-in-progress. It's unlikely it will stay the same forever, I will always be tinkering, but I will try and keep pages evergreen, or at least up-to-date where I can.

    <p>Listed below are various pages you can find here on this website.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/reviews">Reviews</a> things I have been engaging with lately</li>
      <li><a href="/timeline">Timeline of Earth History</a> a fruitless attempt at writing a chronology of all of this</li>
      <li><a href="/questions">Questions</a> (and some answers)</li>
    </ul>
