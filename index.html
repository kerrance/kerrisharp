      <h2>My name is Kerri Sharp-Scott.</h2>

      <p>I am curious, empathetic and always seeking the truth.</p>

      <p>
        My most firmly held value is to "see the bigger picture". Critical thinking and asking questions are very
        important to me.
      </p>

      <p>I enjoy singing, dancing and playing Mario Kart. I quite like <a href="/adages">adages</a> also.</p>

      <p>
        I live in Somerset, England with my wife, <a href="//jessica.scot/" target="_blank">Jessica</a> and our
        daughter.
      </p>
