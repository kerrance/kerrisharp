          <h2>My philosophy</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          I have been building websites using HTML & CSS as a hobby since 1999. I first dabbled with PHP & MySQL in 2003
          when I hosted an open-source forum software for my friends to exchange messages online after school (wannabe
          Mark Zuckerberg?! haha).
        </p>
        <p>
          When I left school, I explored roles as a podcast host, radio &amp; club DJ, record label manager, journalist
          and even head of digital for an election campaign. All of my experiences have deepened my understanding and
          appreciation for the digital media landscape. In 2016, I left the music business and began to turn my hobby
          for web development into a career.
        </p>

        <p>
          My initial foray into professional web development involved working for agencies. Whilst this provided
          valuable experience and the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, I quickly found that the demands
          of agency work often led to creating bloated websites. Client expectations and the desire to impress with
          flashy features, frequently resulted in overly complex designs and an overreliance on third-party services and
          packages. This often felt at odds with my desire to create elegant and user-friendly experiences. I began to
          crave projects with a more defined scope where I could prioritise simplicity and functionality over anything
          unnecessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, I greatly enjoy writing simple and clean, stripped back websites. I prefer to work on minimalist
          projects where only what is required is used: no tracking scripts, no cookies, no pop ups, just simple HTML,
          CSS and vanilla JS.
