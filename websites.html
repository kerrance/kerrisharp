          <h2>My philosophy</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          I have been building websites using HTML & CSS as a hobby since 1999. I first dabbled with PHP & MySQL in 2003
          when I hosted an open-source forum software for my friends to exchange messages online after school (wannabe
          Mark Zuckerberg?! haha).
        </p>

        <p>
          My initial foray into professional web development as a career involved working for agencies. Whilst this
          provided valuable experience and the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, I quickly found that the
          demands of agency work often led to creating bloated websites. Client expectations and the desire to impress
          with flashy features, frequently resulted in overly complex designs and an overreliance on third-party
          services and packages. This often felt at odds with my desire to create elegant and user-friendly experiences.
          I began to crave projects with a more defined scope where I could prioritise simplicity and functionality over
          anything unnecessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, I greatly enjoy writing simple and clean, stripped back websites. I prefer to work on minimalist
          projects where only what is required is used: no invasive tracking scripts, no sneaky cookies and no pop ups!

        <p>
          I believe that a website should be an extension of the person or the business that it represents. It should be
          intuitive, accessible and fast. My goal is to create websites that not only look good, but also provide a
          seamless user experience. I am passionate about web standards &amp; best practices and I strive to write
          clean, maintainable code.
        </p>
