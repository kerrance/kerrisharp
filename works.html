    <h2>Intelligence Fusion</h2>

    <p>I started working with <a href="https://www.intelligencefusion.co.uk/" target="_blank">Intelligence Fusion</a> in autumn 2021. They provide threat-intelligence for public and private sector organisations to protect their assets and employees. Currently, I am working on improving and increasing their API offering with new features and enhancements.</p>

    <h2>Think Productive</h2>

    <p><a href="https://thinkproductive.com/" target="_blank">Think Productive</a> provide productivity training workshops and resources to teams and employees in several regions across the globe. I spent most of 2021 rebuilding the customer facing websites for all of Think Productive's global operating regions.</p>

    <p>I used PHP with WordPress, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, CSS (SASS) and HTML to recreate their websites with a redesigned HiDPI, responsive front-end. I worked closely with their graphic designer in order to make sure that the visual elements from their recent re-brand were used as the building blocks for the new websites.</p>

    <p>On the back-end, I split up Think Productive's previous WordPress multi-site into several new single sites. This process allowed each region to now operate independently, but required lots of MySQL work and was fairly time consuming. Because each operating region has different requirements, I also created many customisable options using the WordPress theme and plug-in capabilities, allowing each site owner to uniquely customise their website for their region. Additionally, I introduced a version system which allows for new features and fixes to be delivered via centralised updates as they are implemented (using semantic versioning and the GitHub 'Releases' feature).</p>

    <p>Over the summer of 2021, I created a bespoke WordPress plug-in to facilitate the creation of an asynchronous learning platform for Think Productive's customers. This platform now sits alongside the websites as an additional resource. The plug-in allows Think Productive to provide their customers with post-workshop learning materials, video and text resources and links that they can use to carry on their learning in their own time.</p>

    <h2>LG Promotions</h2>

    <p>I spent most of my time in 2020 building the <a href="https://appliances.lg-promos.com/" target="_blank">LG Home Appliance</a> and <a href="https://entertainment.lg-promos.com" target="_blank">LG Entertainment</a> platforms. This was completed as part of my full-time work at <a href="https://www.opia.com/" target="_blank">Opia</a>.</p>

    <p>The websites allow LG to encourage the sale of white goods and home entertainment products to their customers across the USA. All current and future promotions on the platform will allow customers to "bundle" together different types of products to apply for greater rewards (primarily, cashback). These projects consumed many hours and lots of overtime to complete.</p>

    <p>These LG platforms are SPAs made with VueJS. Working on these projects was my first experience with automated testing for the frontend: particularly using Cypress and ESLint. My main area of focus was setting up the frontend features to match the client's expectations. I also used Opia's internal APIs to set up the required data and logic for reward calculations.</p>

    <p>Now that both platforms have launched, they will continue to run for the next couple of years with a variety of promotions still to come.</p>

    <h2>Homepages</h2>

    <p>In my own time, I enjoy making simple, fast and minimal websites. Because my contracted work often requires me to keep up-to-date with modern web standards, it's refreshing to strip back my personal projects (including this website!) to the core requirements.</p>

    <p>Listed are some of the homepages that I work on and maintain in my spare time for family.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://jessica.scot/" target="_blank">Jessica Scott</a> Personal site and homepage for Jessica Scott.</li>
      <li><a href="https://jaimiesharp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jaimie Sharp</a> Showcase of my brother's artwork.</li>
      <li><a href="https://portmanteaumusic.com/" target="_blank">Portmanteau Agency</a> Portfolio for a sync-licensing agency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experiments</h2>

    <p>As part of my learning, I often release my experiments publicly on <a href="https://github.com/kerrance" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a>.</p>

    <p>Listed are some recent examples that I have made publicly available:</p>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kerrance/cactuar" target="_blank">Cactuar</a> A simple collapsible content component.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kerrance/moogle" target="_blank">Moogle</a> A simple pop-up modal component.</li>
