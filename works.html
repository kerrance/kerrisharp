    <h2>Think Productive</h2>

    <p>I have spent most of 2021 so far working on a new set of websites for <a href="https://thinkproductive.com/" target="_blank">Think Productive</a>.</p>

    <p>In January through May 2021, I worked on a contract basis to rebuild several of their customer facing websites for all of their globally operating regions. I used PHP for WordPress, vanilla Javascript, CSS (SASS) and HTML to recreate their websites with a redesigned HiDPI, responsive frontend.</p>

    <p>On the backend, I split up their WordPress multi-sites into several new single sites (requiring plenty of MySQL work). Because each operating region has different requirements, I also created many customisable options using WordPress' theme and plugin capabilities, allowing each site owner to uniquely customise their website for their region. I also introduced a versioning system which allows for new features and fixes to be delivered via updates as they are implemented.</p>

    <p>Over the Summer of 2021, I am also working on a bespoke WordPress plugin in order to facilitate the creation of an asynchronous learning platform for their customers.</p>

    <h2>LG Promotions</h2>

    <p>I spent most of my working hours during 2020 building the <a href="https://appliances.lg-promos.com/" target="_blank">LG Home Appliance</a> and <a href="https://entertainment.lg-promos.com" target="_blank">LG Entertainment</a> platforms. This was completed as part of my full-time role at <a href="https://www.opia.com/" target="_blank">Opia</a>.</p>

    <p>The websites allow LG to incentivise the sale of white goods and home entertainment products to their customers across the USA. All current and future promotions on the platform will encourage customers to "bundle" together different types of products to apply for greater rewards (primarily, cashback). These projects consumed many hours and lots of overtime to complete across the summer and autumn of 2020.</p>

    <p>These LG platforms are SPAs made with VueJS. Working on these projects was my first experience with automated testing for the frontend: particularly using Cypress and ESLint. My main area of focus was setting up the frontend features to match the client's expectations. I also used Opia's internal APIs to set up the required data and logic for reward calculations.</p>

    <p>Now that both platforms have launched, they will continue to run for the next couple of years with a variety of promotions still to come.</p>

    <h2>Homepages</h2>

    <p>I enjoy making simple, fast and minimal websites in my own time. Because my contracted work often requires me to keep up-to-date with modern web standards, it's refreshing to strip back my personal projects (including this website!) to the core requirements.</p>

    <p>Listed are some of the homepages that I work on and maintain in my spare time for friends and family.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://jessica.scot/" target="_blank">Jessica Scott</a> Personal site and homepage for Jessica Scott.</li>
      <li><a href="https://jaimiesharp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jaimie Sharp</a> Showcase of my brother's artwork.</li>
