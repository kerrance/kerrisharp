    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>I have been making websites for over 20 years. What started as a hobby became my main job a few years ago.</p>

    <p>I loved video games as a child, my dream was to create my own games when I grew up. When I discovered the internet at the turn of the millennium, I felt very strongly about the future of this technology &ndash; I had to learn how to use it and get involved. I would stay up late most school nights building fan-pages and websites about my favourite games, bands and TV shows.</p>

    <p>After leaving school and before going full-time writing code for work, I worked a variety of different jobs. My mum calls me "fad man" because I have tried lots of different things. I have worked in the music industry as a record label manager, as a games journalist, radio presenter, club DJ, technology manager for a political campaign and even a few times as a cocktail mixologist.</p>

    <p>These days, when not building applications, websites or emails, I enjoy reading, learning, debating and listening to music.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <p>I always want to create honest, well-designed bespoke applications, websites and emails. I use a variety of tools, frameworks and languages to achieve this goal.</p>

    <p>Providing and maintaining open access to information and learning opportunities for everybody is very important to me. The early "wild west" internet was, for me, the perfect opportunity for enabling people to learn and grow. I will always endeavour to champion freedom of speech and discourage censorship in my life and in my work.</p>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>

    <p>As a child, Tetris was my first and favourite video game. I find that my life and my work is sometimes quite similar to clearing blocks in Tetris. Attention to detail and forward-thinking are my specialities.</p>

    <p>I like to keep my email inbox and my in-tray at zero. I review all of my projects weekly to ensure my next steps are clear. I hit my deadlines by maintaining a thorough to-do list and promptly addressing any blockers.</p>

    <p>I have been a carer my entire life for my brother Jaimie. My brother has autism and learning difficulties, which makes communication for him very difficult. Growing up as a carer and being very close with Jaimie has given me a good deal of empathy and understanding. I find this a definite strength in the workplace, especially when working alongside others who may be on the spectrum themselves.</p>

    <p>My mum has always encouraged me to look at "the bigger picture" in life. As a child, I did not fully understand the significance of this, but the older I get, the more that I appreciate this gift. "Seeing the bigger picture" allows me to understand and empathise with people with different beliefs and viewpoints.

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>

    <p>My memory is not brilliant. As Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) recommends, I often prefer to trust in systems to meet my goals and keep track of my responsibilities rather than relying on my memory alone.</p>

    <p>My girlfriend has observed that I often make the same mistake twice before learning not to again. She might be right about that...!</p>

    <p>I often feel a sense of disconnection with my body, which can make me seem physically clumsy at times. I also find sports and fitness in general difficult as a result of this.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I have been accused of "sitting on the fence" in certain debates. I try hard to understand all people's viewpoints and to "keep the peace", but sometimes this can lead me to feel muddled and find it difficult to communicate my own beliefs.</p>
