    <h2>Who?</h2>

    <p>I'm a British web developer currently living in Somerset, England.</p>

    <p>I've been making websites on-and-off for over 20 years. What started as a hobby became my main gig a few years ago.</p>

    <p>Before going full-time as a web developer, I worked in the music industry as a record label manager. I've also worked as a games journalist, radio presenter, club DJ and even one time as a cocktail barman.</p>

    <p>When not programming, I enjoy public speaking, writing, podcasting, DJing, making cocktails, video editing, tennis and collecting music.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>I always want to create honest, well-designed bespoke websites and emails from scratch. I use a variety of tools, frameworks and languages to achieve this goal.</p>

    <p>I like to keep my email inbox at zero. I review all of my projects weekly to ensure my next steps are clear. I hit my deadlines by maintaining a thorough to-do list and promptly addressing any blockers.</p>

    <p>When I can, I'll work on something special for a friend, family member or colleague. Most of my side-projects are open source and publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/kerrance" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
