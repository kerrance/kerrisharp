I used to have lots of content here, but I took it all down a couple of years ago.

I went through a phase of wanting to remove everything about myself from the public sphere. Then, one day, I thought that it will be interesting to write *something* here for my own sake. It is a bonus if you also find this interesting to read.

I enjoy working on this website as an exercise in stripping back to the core fundamentals of web design. I try to write as if I am talking to a friend or colleague.
