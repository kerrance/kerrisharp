        <h2>Should I upgrade to Windows 11?</h2>
      </summary>

      <p>Windows 10 was meant to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows" target="_blank">"the last version of Windows"</a>, unfortunately, this no longer appears to be the case. Windows 11 was released in late 2021 and introduced a variety of visual and lifestyle upgrades over the previous version.</p>

      <p>Windows 11 does look nicer visually, however, it also launched without a lot of key features that were promised as well as a long list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_features_removed_in_Windows_11" target="_blank">features from Windows 10 that have been removed</a>, and these might have been important to you.</p>

      <p>The biggest change in Windows 11 that you will probably notice immediately is that the 'Start' button and the taskbar has moved. In older versions of Windows, the taskbar was aligned to the bottom left of the screen. In Windows 11, the taskbar has been moved to the bottom center of the screen. If you have been using Windows for many years, you will probably find this change quite alarming. However, you can <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/windows-11-taskbar-left/" target="_blank">move the taskbar back to the bottom left</a> if you prefer it where it used to be.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, whether you decide to upgrade is your choice, but as usual, I would recommend you wait a year or so to give Microsoft the opportunity to fix any bugs and finish polishing new features.</p>

        <h2>Should I buy a laptop or a tablet device?</h2>
      </summary>

      <p>Personally, I find that the answer to this question really depends on what you want to do with the device you purchase.</p>

      <p>For the vast majority of people that ask me this, I actually recommend they buy a tablet device. If you need a device to stream videos, enjoy your photos, listen to music or access websites or social media &mdash; a tablet device is perfect for consuming content and generally cheaper and less bulky to carry.</p>

      <p>However, if you need to 'create' content; either by doing a lot of writing, or graphic design, or video editing, or coding &ndash; a laptop is definitely the choice for you. Although you can do all of these things on a tablet device, it's going to be much more efficient and faster to perform these tasks on a computer or laptop.</p>

        <h2>What phone should I buy?</h2>
      </summary>

      <p>When it comes to smartphones, you have a lot of choice, but innovation has definitely stagnated in recent years. Most modern smartphones have beautifully large displays, top quality cameras and plenty of memory. If you're in the market for a new smartphone, your decision comes down to which operating system you prefer and ultimately, both of the market leaders are very similar. Apple's iOS is only accessible on their iPhone hardware, whereas Android is mainly accessible on Google's devices, as well as third-party handsets from Samsung, Sony, or Motorola etc.</p>
