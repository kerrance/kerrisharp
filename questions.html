        <h2>Should I upgrade to Windows 11?</h2>
      </summary>

      <p>Windows 10 was meant to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows" target="_blank">"the last version of Windows"</a>, unfortunately, this no longer appears to be the case. Windows 11 was released in late 2021 and introduced a variety of visual and lifestyle upgrades over the previous version.</p>

      <p>Windows 11 does look nicer visually, but as usual, I would recommend you wait a year or so to give Microsoft the opportunity to fix any bugs and finish polishing new features. Windows 11 launched without a lot of key features that were promised as well as a long list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_features_removed_in_Windows_11" target="_blank">features from Windows 10 that have been removed</a>, and these might have been important to you.</p>

        <h2>Should I buy a laptop or a tablet device</h2>
      </summary>

      <p>For the vast majority of people that ask me this, I actually recommend they buy a tablet device. If you need a device to stream videos, look at photos, listen to music or access websites or social media &mdash; a tablet device is perfect for consuming content and generally cheaper and less bulky to carry.</p>

      <p>However, if you need to 'create' content; either by doing a lot of writing, or graphic design, or video editing, or coding &ndash; a laptop is definitely the choice for you. Although you can do all of these things on a tablet device, it's going to be much more efficient and faster to perform these tasks on a computer or laptop.</p>
