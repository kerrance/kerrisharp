        Final Fantasy X, released in 2001 by "Squaresoft" (now "Square Enix"), is the tenth main instalment in the Final
        Fantasy video game series. Well known for its melodramatic narrative, innovative battle system, and stunning
        graphics (for its time), Final Fantasy X was the first in the series to feature fully-voiced characters and a
        shift from the traditional world map exploration, to a tighter focus on staged set pieces. Focusing on the world
        of Spira, the game follows the story of Tidus, a young athlete transported from his futuristic home of Zanarkand
        to a world plagued by a monstrous entity known as Sin. Accompanying the summoner Yuna and her travelling
        companions (Guardians), Tidus embarks on a pilgrimage to aid Yuna in her quest to stop Sin and uncover the
        mysteries surrounding his own existence.

      <p>
        Beyond its surface-level appeal, Final Fantasy X delves into profound themes of religion, mythology, sacrifice,
        and the human condition, blending them into its intricate plot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Spoiler Warning</strong>: The below points contain spoilers for the entirety of Final Fantasy X. If you
        have not yet completed the game, please keep this in mind.
      </p>

      <h3>Archetypes and Mythology: Fathers, Floods, and Sin</h3>

      <p>
        Final Fantasy X draws heavily from ancient mythology and psychological archetypes. Jecht, Tidus's father,
        represents the classic Father archetype: flawed, distant, and crucial to the hero's journey. His nonchalant
        approach to life "why do today what you can do tomorrow?", stands in stark contrast to Auron's more pragmatic
        attitude of "hurry up and rest," representing two opposing views on responsibility and action from Tidus's two
        father figures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sin, the enormous whale-like monster that ravages Spira, evokes mythological imagery of creatures like the
        biblical Leviathan and stories of being swallowed whole, such as in Pinocchio or Moby Dick. Not only is Sin a
        manifestation of humanity's collective guilt and the destruction it brings upon itself, but Sin is also Tidus's
        father, transformed and destined to wreak havoc on the world of Spira for the rest of time. Sin persists as a
        constant reminder to the people of Spira to repent for their sins. The name "Sin" is a bit on-the-nose, but I
        think it works well as a physical manifestation of the repentance that the people of Spira put themselves
        through.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Sin, the game quite heavy-handidly references the Flood myth, symbolising punishment and rebirth. The
        tradition of the flood-myth is also acknowledged with the aeon "Gilgamesh", the central character of the oldest
        recorded flood-myth, the "Epic of Gilgamesh" from ancient Mesopotamia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Final Fantasy X also tells the tale of Sodom and Gomorrah — a story of divine judgement upon cities steeped in
        sin. Zanarkand, once the thriving city at the heart of Spira, serves as a parallel to Sodom and Gomorrah. It was
        destroyed during the ancient war with Bevelle, a conflict driven by machina (technology) and power. Now, reduced
        to ruins, Zanarkand is a reminder of how hubris and the unchecked pursuit of power lead to downfall—a theme
        echoed in countless myths throughout human history.
      </p>

      <h3>Seymour and the Philosophy of Despair</h3>

      <p>
        Seymour Guado, one of the game's primary antagonists, embodies a deep existential pessimism. His belief that
        "life is suffering, death is salvation" reflects the darker side of human nature and philosophy, echoing
        concepts often found in the works of philosophers like Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. Seymour's nihilism paints
        death as a release from the endless cycle of pain—a sentiment that contrasts sharply with the hope our main cast
        of characters cling to. This philosophical conflict between despair and hope is central to the narrative,
        highlighting the game's deeper explorations of life and death.
      </p>

      <h3>The Al Bhed and Yevonites: A Study in Xenophobia and Racism</h3>

      <p>
        The tension between the Al Bhed and the Yevonites reflects the fear of "the other" that exists in real-world
        societies. The Al Bhed, who reject the teachings of Yevon and embrace machina, are ostracised and marginalised
        by the majority of Spira's inhabitants for their progressive use of electronic technology. This tension
        highlights issues of xenophobia and cultural conflict, showing how fear and misunderstanding can divide
        societies. Despite their differences, both the Al Bhed and the Yevonites are trapped within Sin's destructive
        cycle, illustrating the futility of prejudice in the face of greater existential threats.
      </p>

      <h3>Dreams and the Collective Unconscious: The Fayth and Tidus</h3>

      <p>
        One of the most profound and intriguing aspects of Final Fantasy X is the concept of the Fayth and their ability
        to summon physical manifestations through dreams. The Fayth, trapped in eternal slumber, dream Tidus into
        existence as a proxy of their shared memories and desires. As long as they continue dreaming, Tidus can remain,
        but once they wake, he will vanish. This concept taps into Jungian psychology, where the collective unconscious
        shapes reality through shared symbols and archetypes. Tidus himself, being a product of these dreams, becomes a
        metaphor for the impermanence of life and the fragile nature of existence.
      </p>

      <h3>Yu Yevon's Spiral of Life and Death</h3>

      <p>
        The central theme of the game revolves around the concept of an eternal cycle—what Yunalesca refers to as "Yu
        Yevon's spiral of life and death." Sin is never truly defeated; rather, it is temporarily subdued by a Final
        Aeon, which then becomes the new Sin after merging with Yu Yevon. This endless cycle of destruction and rebirth
        reflects the idea that no amount of atonement can free humanity from its sins. Instead, the people of Spira are
        caught in a loop, performing ritual sacrifices to stave off Sin's return, only to find themselves trapped in the
        same hopeless cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        This mirrors religious and mythological systems where life and death are seen as part of an inescapable
        cycle—where humanity seeks salvation, but is often met with the realisation that ultimate purity or redemption
        is probably unattainable.
      </p>

      <h3>Hope Versus Despair: The Role of Yunalesca</h3>

      <p>
        Lady Yunalesca, one of the game's most enigmatic characters, embodies the tension between hope and despair. She
        waits at the ruins of Zanarkand for the strongest summoner to complete the ritual that will create the Final
        Aeon and temporarily defeat Sin. Yunalesca's belief that it is "better to die in hope, than to live in despair"
        reveals her fatalistic worldview, where death through sacrifice is the only means of salvation. Her character
        design, with snakes for hair akin to Medusa, evokes classical mythology, symbolising wisdom and the danger of
        lust. Her adherence to this endless cycle highlights the tragic side of heroism, where sacrifice is revered, yet
        ultimately damaging.
      </p>

      <h3>Breaking the Cycle: The Final Confrontation and Yu Yevon's Death</h3>

      <p>
        Final Fantasy X ultimately questions whether humanity can ever escape the endless cycle of destruction. The
        Final Aeon, which should represent hope, only provides temporary relief, but perpetuates Sin's existence in the
        long run. As the narrative progresses, the game suggests that a new path might be possible—one that doesn't rely
        on constant sacrifice.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final battle, after defeating the Final Aeon, the party confronts Yu Yevon himself. Yu Yevon, the ancient
        summoner who originally created Sin, is now little more than a mindless entity, obsessed with maintaining the
        cycle of destruction. Stripped of his layers of protection and the constructs he uses to sustain Sin, Yu Yevon
        is vulnerable. In this weakened state, he is defeated by the party, finally breaking the cycle. His death
        represents the end of the spiral of death and rebirth that has defined Spira for so long, offering the
        possibility of a new beginning.
      </p>

      <h3>Hope in the Face of Despair</h3>

      <p>
        Final Fantasy X offers a powerful meditation on the human condition. Through its exploration of mythology,
        archetypes, and the tension between hope and despair, the game challenges players to think about cycles of
        guilt, sacrifice, and redemption. Ultimately, the story suggests that while humanity may be trapped by its past
        and the weight of its collective Sin, there is always the possibility of breaking free. By confronting the
        source of their suffering head-on, the characters in Final Fantasy X forge a new future for Spira—one that is no
        longer bound by the mistakes of the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the dream of the Fayth fades and Sin is finally defeated, the game leaves players with a sense of closure,
        but also with lingering questions about the nature of hope, despair, and the courage it takes to honour the past
        whilst defining a positive future.
