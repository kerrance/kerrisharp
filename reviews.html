      <h1>Reviews</h1>

      <p>Included below are reviews and opinions on things that I have been thinking about recently.</p>
    </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Books</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Talks With a Devil" by P.D. Ouspensky</strong>Two allegorical stories about the nature of the devil from the Slavic mythos. Devils thrive from our materialism and rationalisations.</li>
      <li><strong>"A State of Fear: How the UK government weaponised fear during the Covid-19 pandemic" by Laura Dodsworth</strong>An important document detailing the government and media's methods to exploit psychology and illicit fear in order to coerce the UK population.</li>
      <li><strong>"The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers" by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</strong>A must-read for any software programmer. If you've ever been, or wish to be paid to write code then this book is for you.</li>
      <li><strong>"A Tale for the Time Being" by Ruth Ozeki</strong>Meditations on Zen Buddhism through the lens of a tale of two souls, connected by a tragic real world event.</li>
      <li><strong>"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" by Jordan B Peterson</strong>Insightful meditations on modern life with classic wisdom. Jordan Peterson is the Father most of us never had.</li>
      <li><strong>"Tragedy and Hope 101: The Illusion of Justice, Freedom, and Democracy" by Joseph Plummer</strong>Quigley's Tragedy &amp; Hope is a notoriously long and difficult book to read: Plummer does a great job of breaking it down and adding his own insight into how a cabal technocratic elites gained and maintain control.</li>
      <li><strong>"Animal Farm" by George Orwell</strong>Orwell's allegory for the Russian Revolution won't be forgotten easily. Animal Farm is short, yet it contains many similar themes and concepts to Orwell's other well-known dystopia novel. Animal Farm is a fantastic way to teach the brutal concepts of socialism in action to children or young adults.</li>
      <li><strong>"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying" by Marie Kondō</strong>Truly joyful to read. Maybe not for everyone, but Kondo presents a tried and true method for cutting down your possessions and living in a cleaner environment. I've not read a book before which makes me feel so clean and my mind so tidy, every time I flick through it. Even touching this book for me "sparks joy", I still dip back into this every now and then.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Music</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Escapades" by Gaspard Auge</strong>Expanding on Justice's more recent prog-rock output, "Escapades" collates the Italian horror soundtrack sound with epic video game adventure vibes.</li>
      <li><strong>"Miss Anthropocene" by Grimes</strong>Thematically mixed concept album. There's some brilliant industrial and electro songs here, but the concept falls flat by the end.</li>
      <li><strong>"ネオ東京" by マクロスMACROSS 82-99</strong>Summer-time jams from both the past and the future. This quintessential 'future funk' album won't fail to put a smile on your face.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Movies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time" on Amazon Prime</strong>A true end for Evangelion, showing growth in Anno's younger otaku world-view. Humanity isn't a hedgehog's dilemma when given hope.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Exercise</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Beginners Brazilian Jiu-jitsu</strong>Roll around and try to grapple your opponent until submission. I have no idea what I'm doing, but it's fun, physically demanding exercise.</li>
      <li><strong>Hannah Frankson's Peloton Classes</strong>Go hard, ride fast and sweat buckets! Hannah's classes are wall-to-wall, bass-heavy British club bangers.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Games</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Death Stranding" on PC</strong>Jeffrey Bezos and Daryl from The Walking Dead attempt to make American great again with Fedex, unborn babies and wireless internet.</li>
      <li><strong>"Hynospace Outlaw" on PC</strong>A weird and wonderful simulation of the wild-west, late 90s internet 1.0.</li>
      <li><strong>"Paratopic" on PC</strong>A lo-fi indie horror game with an eerie PS1-era aesthetic. If Silent Hill was directed by David Lynch.</li>
      <li><strong>"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" on Nintendo Switch</strong>Silky smooth, saccharine multiplayer fun in HD. Nintendo actually made the confectionery kart game from "Wreck It Ralph" a reality.</li>
    </ul>
