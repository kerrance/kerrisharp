      <p>Listed below are some thoughts about the things that I have been engaging with lately.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Books</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>"Nuclear War: A Scenario" by Annie Jacobsen</strong> This is a non-fiction book, including many
            sources and interviews, about what might happen if there is a nuclear war. It's quite a good book, albeit
            terrifying. I read the whole thing in just 2 days, definitely "gripping" as they say. I recommend it for
            anyone who is curious about the bleak reality of nuclear war and what that would be like. Definitely don't
            read it before bed though...
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>
              "A State of Fear: How the UK government weaponised fear during the Covid-19 pandemic" by Laura Dodsworth
            </strong>
            An important document detailing the government and media's methods to exploit psychology and illicit fear in
            order to coerce the UK population.
          </li>

        <h2>Movies</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Northman</strong> Bloody, brutal and brilliant. This epic story of a blood-thirsy Nord captures
            the desire of revenge incredibly well, but, reality is not always what it seems.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Batman</strong> This is Gotham City portrayed as truly "gothic" and it's absolutely brilliant.
            Brutal, but brilliant. Thankfully, this re-telling skips the now well-troden origin story and gets straight
            to the detective work &ndash; this is Batman at his very best.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Godspell</strong> Totally bonkers musical re-telling of the early New Testament. The Big J is
            represented as a clown who gathers a group of lost individuals to rejoice across the empty streets of 1970s
            New York City. Definitely one for repeat viewings, the story is difficult to follow through song, but the
            soundtrack is very good.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>TV</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Little House on the Prairie</strong> Good wholesome light entertainment. This is a very rosy
            portrayal of the American Dream. I like that many of today's problem's feel unique to the modern day, but
            the families portrayed here often share the same problems we do now.
