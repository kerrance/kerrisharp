      <p>Listed below are some thoughts about the things that I have been engaging with lately.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Books</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" by Gabrielle Zevin</strong> This is a love story; love for
            human connection, the art, history and spirit of video games and the love of the American Dream. There's not
            a lot of romance here, but it is a love story. I appreciated the many references and patchwork quilt
            storytelling pulling from video games from my own past, like Ready Player One before it. That said, the two
            central characters aren't massively likeable, they are interesting for sure, but deeply flawed. I'm not sure
            I would replay this one, but I did enjoy it right up until the GAME OVER screen hit.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Only Love Is Real" by Brian Weiss</strong> Very interesting perspective on a subject I hadn't
            thought much about before: past-life regression. Weiss tells the stories of patients he has worked with to
            help them trace their past lives through history. Big if true. Lots of food for thought here.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Nuclear War: A Scenario" by Annie Jacobsen</strong> This is a non-fiction book, including many
            sources and interviews, about what might happen if there is a nuclear war. It's quite a good book, albeit
            terrifying. I read the whole thing in just 2 days, definitely "gripping" as they say. I recommend it for
            anyone who is curious about the bleak reality of nuclear war and what that would be like. Definitely don't
            read it before bed though...
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>
              "A State of Fear: How the UK government weaponised fear during the Covid-19 pandemic" by Laura Dodsworth
            </strong>
            An important document detailing the government and media's methods to exploit psychology and illicit fear in
            order to coerce the UK population.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Dangling Man" by Saul Bellow</strong> Does a person require limitation to enjoy their life? Does a
            prisoner savour and cherish freedom more because they have none? The Dangling Man is an interesting book
            because it urges you to ask yourself questions about your own approach to freedom, autonomy and duty. I
            found it an interesting comparison, reading this during a government lockdown, when my own liberty was
            restricted.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"The Story of the British Isles in 100 Places" by Neil Oliver</strong> There's a lot of history in
            these islands.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Music</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>"Home Again" by Michael Kiwanuka</strong> Chilled 70's inspired soul record. The sound, as well as
            the artwork on the packaging are beautifully nostalgic.
          </li>

          <li><strong>"Changes" by Charles Bradley</strong> Incredible voice. Rest in peace.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Movies</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Apocalypse Now</strong> Good does not always triumph. We are all capable of leading humanity into an
            apocalyse. This movie wants the viewer to wrestle with these ideas whilst considering the futility of a war
            that cannot be won, helped by people who didn't particular want to be there.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Escape from New York</strong> Snake Pliskin is clearly memorable as your classic 80s action movie
            lead. He's cool, so cool, too cool maybe? Unfortunately, The Duke is underutilised for such a great
            "villain". John Carpenter's soundtrack is brilliant as you would expect if you also enjoyed "Assault on
            Precinct 13".
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Her</strong> Beautiful visuals, it's pleasing to see a utopian vision of the future amongst so many
            depictions of dystopia in Hollywood. The "character progression" of Theodore was fumbled somewhat though,
            which lets this movie down.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Godzilla &times; Kong: The New Empire</strong> Very, very silly, but good fun. Bring popcorn!</li>

          <li>
            <strong>Bob Marley: One Love</strong> Great music, but a formulaic biopic. I did learn a lot about Jamaica
            and the context of Marley's music which I didn't know about before.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Dune: Part Two</strong> The space messiah leads a galactic war for the ownership rights of space
            cocaine whilst also attempting to liberate oppressed peoples of Arrakis. Both Dune films have been
            outstanding sci-fi.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Blade Runner</strong> Inspirational and unforgettable visual style, characters, soundtrack and mood,
            but with a poorly executed plot. The sequel improved on this in every possible way.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Northman</strong> Bloody, brutal and brilliant. This epic story of a blood-thirsy Nord captures
            the desire of revenge incredibly well, but, reality is not always what it seems.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Batman</strong> This is Gotham City portrayed as truly "gothic" and it's absolutely brilliant.
            Brutal, but brilliant. Thankfully, this re-telling skips the now well-troden origin story and gets straight
            to the detective work &ndash; this is Batman at his very best.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Godspell</strong> Totally bonkers musical re-telling of the early New Testament. The Big J is
            represented as a clown who gathers a group of lost individuals to rejoice across the empty streets of 1970s
            New York City. Definitely one for repeat viewings, the story is difficult to follow through song, but the
            soundtrack is very good.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2</strong> Better than I thought it would be honestly.
            Definitely the best film of the series.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Back to the Future (Trilogy)</strong> We watched these in the cinema with popcorn and fizzy pop -
            the complete experience as it was intended! Incredible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>TV</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Little House on the Prairie</strong> Good wholesome light entertainment. This is a very rosy
            portrayal of the American Dream. I like that many of today's problem's feel unique to the modern day, but
            the families portrayed here often share the same problems we do now.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Line of Duty</strong> Binge-worthy police procedural full of twists and turns. I'm hooked!</li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Crown</strong> I'm neither pro, nor anti, monarchy, but this Netflix drama helped me understand
            their role in modern Britain and it is brilliant. Also, my favourite Doctor Who is in it, although sadly, he
            never wears a fez this time!
          </li>

          <li><strong>Normal People</strong> I didn't read the book, but the show was very nostalgic.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Good Place</strong> I watched the first series in one night, I was instantly hooked! The rest of
            the seasons weren't as good, but I still enjoyed this.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Documentaries</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Corbett Report documentaries on LBRY</strong> In particular, the 4-part doc about the role that Bill
            & Melinda Gates Foundation play in global public health.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Rotten", "Patriot Act" and "Fyre Festival" on Netflix</strong> Some brilliant "red pill" content
            about areas you might never have even thought about.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>
              G. Edward Griffin's 1984 interview with propaganda-agent and KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov on YouTube
            </strong>
            The concept of "Active Measures" explains a lot of what is happening today.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Games</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Age of Empires IV</strong> The most captivating history documentary I have yet seen. The creators
            Relic Entertainment had an almost impossible task: faithfully rejuvenate a classic of the RTS genre whilst
            also updating the gameplay for modern audiences &nbsp; I really think they did a great job. My absolute
            favourite aspect is the campaign mode, complete with documentary footage giving the history before each
            challenge.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> An absolutely beautiful trainwreck of a game. Night City is one of the most
            visually impressive world's in a video game I've experienced. It's up there with 'Everybody's Gone to the
            Rapture' on the list of places that are such a joy to experience that gameplay easily takes a back-seat.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Death Stranding</strong> Jeffrey Bezos and Daryl from The Walking Dead attempt to make American
            great again with Fedex, unborn babies and wireless internet.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Everything</strong> I had dreams about jumping into other creatures and then into a planet after
            playing this. I love that you really can be 'Everything' in this fun, imaginative game. The talks from Alan
            Watt that soundtrack the beautiful score are great additions.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> I didn't like this at first, but it has really
            grown on me. It's the most intricate Zelda adventure to date, that's for sure!
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Hypnospace Outlaw</strong> A weird and wild simulation of the wild-west, late 90s internet 1.0.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Paratopic</strong> A lo-fi indie horror game with an eerie PS1-era aesthetic. If Silent Hill was
            directed by David Lynch.
          </li>
