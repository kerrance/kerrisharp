    <h1>Reviews</h1>

    <p>Included below are reviews of things that I have been thinking about recently.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Books</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Talks With a Devil" by P.D. Ouspensky</strong> Two allegorical stories about the nature of the devil from the Slavic mythos. Devils thrive from our materialism and rationalisations.</li>
      <li><strong>"A State of Fear: How the UK government weaponised fear during the Covid-19 pandemic" by Laura Dodsworth</strong> An important document detailing the government and media's methods to exploit psychology and illicit fear in order to coerce the UK population.</li>
      <li><strong>"The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers" by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</strong> A must-read for any software programmer. If you've ever been, or wish to be paid to write code, then this book is for you.</li>
      <li><strong>"A Tale for the Time Being" by Ruth Ozeki</strong> Meditations on Zen Buddhism through the lens of a tale of two souls, connected by a tragic real world event.</li>
      <li><strong>"Tragedy and Hope 101: The Illusion of Justice, Freedom, and Democracy" by Joseph Plummer</strong> Quigley's Tragedy & Hope is a notoriously long and difficult book to read: Plummer does a great job of breaking it down and adding his own insight into how a cabal technocratic elites gained and maintain control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Movies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Dune" in cinemas</strong> I thought this movie was really great: it looks amazing, has a brilliant soundtrack and provides a lot of detailed lore... BUT I really wish it wasn't split across two movies...</li>
      <li><strong>"Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time" on Amazon Prime</strong> A true end for Evangelion, showing growth in Anno's younger otaku world-view. Humanity isn't a hedgehog's dilemma when given hope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Television</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Bitter Lake" on BBC iPlayer</strong> In true Adam Curtis fashion, this documentary is heavy on the aesthetic. It gives an insightful history of the situation in Afghanistan and the formation of the Afghan mujahidin groups.</li>
      <li><strong>"Monkey Dust" on BBC Three</strong> Long-since removed from iPlayer, this dark comedy is still deeply relevant today. Harsh but true gags about British politics, outrage & celebrity culture and modernity in general. If Radiohead's 'Paranoid Android' video was a TV show, it would probably be like this.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Games</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Cyberpunk 2077" on PC</strong> An absolutely beautiful trainwreck of a game. Night City is one of the most visually impressive world's in a video game I've experienced. It's up there with 'Everybody's Gone to the Rapture' on the list of places that are such a joy to experience that gameplay easily takes a backseat.</li>
      <li><strong>"Death Stranding" on PC</strong> Jeffrey Bezos and Daryl from The Walking Dead attempt to make American great again with Fedex, unborn babies and wireless internet.</li>
      <li><strong>"Everything" on PC</strong> I had dreams about jumping into other creatures and then into a planet after playing this. I love that you really can be 'Everything' in this fun, imaginative game. The talks from Alan Watt that soundtrack the beautiful score are great additions.</li>
      <li><strong>"Hynospace Outlaw" on PC</strong> A weird and wonderful simulation of the wild-west, late 90s internet 1.0.</li>
      <li><strong>"Paratopic" on PC</strong> A lo-fi indie horror game with an eerie PS1-era aesthetic. If Silent Hill was directed by David Lynch.</li>
    </ul>
